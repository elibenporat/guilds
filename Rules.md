# Guilds Of Octal
In Guilds of Octal, you enter a unique world, comprised of unusual octagonal tiles (octiles). On this 8x8 board, you will battle over Octal’s 8 resources, one of which you will have greater influence over. After choosing your guild’s identity, you embark on a battle to squeeze the most prestige out of this strange land.

## Setup

Turn all the ? tokens so that the resource diamond isn’t visible. Shufle them and place them on the 49 diamonds. Flip them over to reveal which resources they are.
Place all the upgrade tiles next to the game board. Give each player 4 of each resource type.

Select a first player.

First player selects which colour she wants, then each player in order selects a colour (clockwise around the table). The last player then selects which guild she wants to play, then each player (in reverse order) selects their guild. Certain guildsmay interact better with certain faction colours, or the random resources on the board. If choosing to play without guilds, the last player chooses a colour first, then reverse order (i.e. counter-clockwise) until the first player.

Set the market to 5 for all colours chosen, and 4 for all other colours.

### Preparation Actions
1. 	Faction Resource Action (Take 4 of your colour, move market up one spot. This market movement is doubled if another player has played the x2 market action, or locked, if a player has locked market movement for the round).
2. 	Trade with the Market (one transaction with each resource type)
3. 	Use up to one of each of your action upgrade tiles, and/or discard an upgrade tile (end game victory upgrades that you don’t score points for can earn points for your opponents)
4. 	Remove a resource diamond of your colour OR add a resource diamond of your colour OR move a resource diamond of your colour from one spot to another (empty) spot.

    Each type of action may only be played once per turn. The first action is free, all subsequent actions cost (2,4,4) respectively, paid in whichever resource is the most abundant/cheapest on the market. This may change between actions if a player is using her market action, buildings, or founding a city.

### Colonization Actions
1. 	Place an Octile (each player has 8)
    * Choose which resource tile that Octile is producing.
    * All resource diamonds of that type connected to that Octile are removed from the board. The octile now produces the number of diamonds +1.
    * An octile may not be placed next to a city you have founded, unless your faction allows this.
2. 	Produce in any or all of your settlements/cities
    * Any players with octiles connected to a producing settlement/city, will produce as well.
    * Only the tiles directly connected to your settlement/city you choose to produce in will produce
3. 	Create a city by merging multiple tiles
    * Each pattern has a specific bonus and is known to all players (8 basic patterns)
    * Gain the bonus for founding the city, as per the player board.
4. 	Purchase an upgrade tile (8 of each type of upgrade)

    Each type of action may only be played once per turn. First colonization action is free, subsequent ones cost 4, 8, 8 of your colour.

Game ends when a player has placed all 8 of their Octiles and then initiates the GAME END for their faction. Each other player will then have one final turn after this is triggered.
